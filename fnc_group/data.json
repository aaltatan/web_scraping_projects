We have built a solid reputation in both exporting and importing of consignments as we have variously handled cargo for charter flights in the past.<br /><br />Coordinating cargo is an all-embracing vocation in which there are many players. We have been able to distinguish ourselves through our humble and honest approach to customers as well as efficiency and dispatch with which we handle our assignments, be it at airports or sea port.<br /><br />Permit us therefore to observe that although many organizations at the moment parade themselves as cargo coordinators, it should be borne in mind that coordinating cargo is a specialized field at Airline representation. Therefore, in contacting an agent as an airline Sole cargo agent, an important variable, which deserves foremost consideration, is the track record of the organization in question.<br /><br />In all, cargo coordination conceptualizes how best to route a particular consignment before arriving at the actual destination. The consignment may be perishable, live animals fragile wares or even human remains."
